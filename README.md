# Your Quote App

Welcome to **Your Quote App**! This is a simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing the Fetch API to retrieve and display quotes. The app features a loader to enhance user experience during the quote-fetching process and also integrates with Twitter, allowing users to share their favorite quotes with a single click.
